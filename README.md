- 📫 How to reach me

- Most of the projects below serve as an archive on my process of learning how to code. The most current repositories are Python and Matlab.
- Many of these are school projects, however for privacy reasons I have not included school/assignment/course/professor names in the repository or file names, though they may appear as comments in the files themselves. I only posted code I wrote (I did not include group work), though if I do in the future, it will be only with explicit permission from collaborators.
